     * 11000
     * 00000

    /**
     * ID: 130
     * Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O),
     * capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
     * A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
     * Example:
     * X X X X
     * X O O X
     * X X O X
     * X O X X

     * After running your function, the board should be:
     * X X X X
     * X X X X
     * X X X X
     * X O X X
     * Explanation:
     *
     * Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on
     * the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the
     * border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'.
     * Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or
     * vertically.
